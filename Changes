Revision history for Perl extension Email::MIME::ContentType

{{$NEXT}}
        - better parsing all around, thanks to Pali Roh√°r:
        - support for RFC 2231 (character set and parameter continuations)
        - support for RFC 2822 comments
        - we only Carp if header-parsing fails now
        - we're more lenient in dealing with spaces around tokens

        - correct the longstanding and embarrassing misuse of "discrete" and
          "composite" to mean "type" and "subtype"; the returned data still
          contains the wrong old names so your code shouldn't break
